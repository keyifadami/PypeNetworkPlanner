<h1> PypeNetworkPlanner</h1>

<p> PypeNetworkPlanner is organized into 5 subdirectories. Each directory constitutes a module.</p>

<p> Each module handles a different part of the project, the modules are:</p>

<p> graph : this is the underlying data strucuture in which all the relevant data in the software is stored </p>
<p> gui : this handles all the graphical interface which the user, uses to interact with the graph </p>
<p> icons : this simply holds all the images and icons used in the software </p>
<p> solver : solver, although currently empty, is meant to hold all files used to solve simulations (an interface for the graph and solver will have to be constructed)</p>
<p> utils(utilities) : this is a general purpose module to hold functions and classes that do not fit will into the above catagories but are still necessary (e.g. math functions)</p>
